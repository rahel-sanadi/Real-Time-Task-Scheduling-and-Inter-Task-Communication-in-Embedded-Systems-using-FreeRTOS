Temperature Monitoring and Alert System with LED Indicator Using LPC1768 and FreeRTOS

This repository demonstrates a temperature monitoring system using FreeRTOS on the LPC1768 microcontroller. The system simulates temperature readings, triggers alerts when the temperature exceeds a threshold, and provides LED visual alerts and UART message notifications.

Project Overview

Microcontroller: LPC1768

RTOS: FreeRTOS

Peripherals Used: GPIO (LED), UART0

Simulated Feature: Temperature sensor readings

The project contains two tasks:

Temperature Read Task: Reads simulated temperature values every 1 second and triggers alerts if the temperature exceeds 35째C.

Alert Task: Blinks LED1 (P1.19) three times to indicate a high-temperature alert and then suspends itself until the next alert.

File Structure
File	Description
temp_monitor_demo.c	Main program demonstrating temperature monitoring, alert triggering, and LED indication.
uart0.c	UART0 driver for initialization, transmitting, and receiving bytes/strings.
uart0.h	UART0 header file with macros, function prototypes, and configuration definitions.
Features

Temperature Simulation: Incremental temperature values from 25째C to 40째C for demonstration.

High-Temperature Alerts: Triggers when simulated temperature exceeds 35째C.

LED Alert: LED1 blinks three times on each high-temperature event.

UART Notifications: Transmits temperature readings and alert messages over UART0.
