LPC1768 FreeRTOS Queue Management Demo

This repository demonstrates the use of FreeRTOS queue management APIs on the LPC1768 microcontroller. The project shows how to send and receive data between tasks using a queue while performing LED blinking and UART message printing.

Project Overview

Microcontroller: LPC1768

RTOS: FreeRTOS

Demonstrated APIs: xQueueSendToBack(), xQueueReceive(), uxQueueMessagesWaiting()

Peripherals Used: GPIO (LED), UART0 (Serial Communication)

The project contains two tasks:

Producer Task: Adds numbers to the queue every second.

Consumer Task: Reads numbers from the queue and blinks LED1 (P1.19) for 200ms on each received number.

File Structure
File	Description
queue1.c	Main program demonstrating queue creation, sending, and receiving data between tasks.
uart0.c	UART0 driver for initialization, transmitting, and receiving bytes/strings.
uart0.h	UART0 header file with macros, function prototypes, and configuration definitions.
Features

Producer-Consumer Model: Producer adds integers to the queue, and Consumer processes them.

Queue Status Monitoring: Uses uxQueueMessagesWaiting() to track the number of free slots.

LED Indication: Consumer blinks LED1 when a number is received.

UART Output: Transmits messages indicating items added to or taken from the queue.
