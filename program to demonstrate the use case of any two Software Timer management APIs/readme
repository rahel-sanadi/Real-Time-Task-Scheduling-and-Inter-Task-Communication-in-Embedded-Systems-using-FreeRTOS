LPC1768 FreeRTOS Software Timer Demo

This repository demonstrates a simulated software timer using FreeRTOS tasks on the LPC1768 microcontroller. The project shows how to use tasks with delays to simulate timer functionality, while controlling LED blinking and sending UART messages.

Project Overview

Microcontroller: LPC1768

RTOS: FreeRTOS

Simulated Feature: Software timer behavior using vTaskDelay()

Peripherals Used: GPIO (LED), UART0 (Serial Communication)

The project contains two tasks:

LED Task: Toggles LED1 (P1.19) every 500ms.

Message Task: Sends a counter message over UART0 every second and simulates a timed event to increase LED blink rate after 5 messages.

File Structure
File	Description

uart0.c	UART0 driver for initialization, transmitting, and receiving bytes/strings.
uart0.h	UART0 header file with macros, function prototypes, and configuration definitions.
Features

Simulated Timer: Uses vTaskDelay() to create timed events.

LED Blinking: LED1 toggles every 500ms by default.

UART Output: Messages sent every second with a counter.

Dynamic Event Simulation: After 5 messages, a note is transmitted indicating the LED will blink faster.
