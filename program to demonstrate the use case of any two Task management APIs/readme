LPC1768 FreeRTOS Task Management Demo

This repository contains a demonstration of FreeRTOS task management APIs on the LPC1768 microcontroller. The project shows how to suspend and resume tasks while performing LED blinking and UART message printing.

Project Overview

Microcontroller: LPC1768

RTOS: FreeRTOS

Demonstrated APIs: vTaskSuspend(), vTaskResume()

Peripherals Used: GPIO (LED), UART0 (Serial Communication)

The project contains two tasks:

LED Task: Blinks LED1 (P1.19) every 500ms and temporarily suspends the Print Task.

Print Task: Sends a counter message over UART0 every second.

File Structure
File	Description
task_mgmt_demo.c	Main program demonstrating task creation, LED control, and task suspension/resumption.
uart0.c	UART0 driver for initializing UART, transmitting, and receiving bytes/strings.
uart0.h	UART0 header file with macros, function prototypes, and configuration definitions.
Features

LED Blinking: LED toggles every 500ms using the LED task.

UART Communication: Print task sends messages with a counter over UART0.

Task Management: After 5 LED blinks, the Print Task is suspended for 3 seconds and then resumed.
